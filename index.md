# Welcome to Samantha Post's page

## Introduction

My name is Samantha Post, and I am a General Course student at the London School of Economics in the Department of Management. Born and raised in New York City, I am in my third year of university studies, devoting my Bachelor's degree at my home insitution, the University of Michigan, to Sports Business, concurrently pursuing a subsidiary concentration in Marketing and Management. My foremost career ambitions reside in working across the professional sports landscape back in the United States, most notably in American Football. While I don't plan on adpoting any data-science specific roles in my endeavors down the line, I plan to leverage the wealth of knowledge and expeirence I acquire from this DS105 class in my foremost domains of interest, which revolve around integrated marketing and brand strategy, both of which benefit tremendously from data extraction, analysis, and visualization. I thoroughly look forward to the duration of this course, both embarking upon the group porject and learning more about the art of data.
